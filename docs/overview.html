            <h1>What Is The Alice Project?</h1>

            <p>The Alice Project is a collection of smaller projects that
            are supposed to teach us about hardware and system software.<p>

            <p>Our original goal was to design, manufacture, and sell a UNIX graphics
            workstation based on the Motorola 88110 microprocessor, which would
            have been state-of-the-art for 1992.  To
            familiarize ourselves with porting UNIX, we ported BSD Net/2 to the
            Macintosh II.  This was freely released as
            <a href="macbsd/">MacBSD</a> (and later as NetBSD/Mac).<p>

            <p>We then jumped into hardware, in 1994 creating the
            <a href="alice1/">Alice I</a>, a simple Z80-based
            system with 7-segment display output, then in 1999 the
            <a href="alice2/">Alice II</a>, a more sophisticated
            modular computer also based on the Z80 microprocessor.<p>

            <p>In 2015, we spent a few weeks trying to resurrect the Alice II.
            Failing that, we designed and built the <a href="alice3/">Alice III</a>,
            also Z80-based but using surface-mount technology and running CP/M 2.2.</p>

            <p>In 2017 we switched gears and built the Alice IV, a hand-held
            tablet capable of running mid-1980's Silicon Graphics demos. It's
            based on the Altera Cyclone V SoC.</p>
