            <h1>Memory Board</h1>

            <p>The third board that we implemented contained our RAM and ROM circuit.
            At first we had an ambitious bank-switched design but later decided to build a
            very simple circuit with just one chip each for RAM and ROM.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0101.jpg">

            <p>Several of our design decisions precipitated from the parts we had laying
            around.  From the Alice I project, we
            already had two 128K static RAM (SRAM) chips and some electrically
            programmable ROM (EPROM) chips.  The dynamic RAM (DRAM) chips
            used used in computers today use a very cheap and simple circuit that
            decays quickly, so the memory controller must refresh that memory.  SRAMs
            do not need a refresh cycle and so are much easier to design around.  We
            also bought (for Alice II) several 16K EPROMS to store our boot and
            utility code.  Our original design included both SRAM chips in a
            bank-switched configuration that included a lot of decode logic.  The banks
            would have been switched using an I/O port and would have allowed us to
            use a kind of segmented memory; 16K of memory at 08000H would have been
            fixed, and 16K at 0C000H would have been switchable.  In our wildest
            dreams we thought that maybe we could build a simple task-switching
            system that would actually keep different programs in different banks.
            In the end we couldn't find the motivation or the time to build software
            nearly that sophisticated.  We started to prototype
            this memory board but finally decided that it was too
            much for our needs.  (And probably too complex for us to have built
            successfully.)</p> 

            <img src="../pics/0105.jpg">

            <p>Our final memory board eliminated almost all of the decode logic except
            for enough to switch between the ROM and RAM.  We wasted most of one
            128K SRAM and provided a hardware toggle to enable or disable one 16K
            region in case we wanted to use it for memory-mapped I/O on another
            board.  We did finally use it for video memory on the video board,
            leaving 32K of RAM.  We incorporated the
            16K EPROM on the board with a zero-insertion force (ZIF) socket, so
            we could easily switch out EPROMs to try new code.  That turned out
            to be a little more painful than we expected, because our drilling wasn't
            completely regular, and slight positioning differences in the pins of the
            socket caused the slots in the socket to be out of alignment.  We ended
            up having to carefully position the EPROM as it was inserted in order
            to guarantee that its pins were held by the socket.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0007.jpg">

            <p>Finally, we created the circuit template online,
            created a circuit board, and
            soldered the memory board together.  It worked pretty well for us and
            was probably the simplest board we built.</p>

            <p>Using an EPROM introduced a whole set of preparation issues into the 
            project.  We used ultra-violet erasable EPROMS (UV-EPROMS) and bought
            a UV-EPROM eraser (basically a box with a UV lamp in it and indentations
            so the EPROMS rested up against the lamp).  The eraser never seemed
            quite reliable, probably because we were sloppy with it and because we
            bought surplus EPROMS.  Sometimes we'd erase for more than half an
            hour and still not have blanked the EPROM.  Occasionally we'd forget
            to turn off the lamp and find the next day (or even later) that we'd
            ruined an EPROM.  We were also nervous about leaving the programmed
            EPROMS out without labels for fear that sunlight would hit them and
            erase the program partially.  We bought an EPROM programmer with DOS
            software and discovered that hardware engineers write software about
            as well as we designed hardware.  We used Linux to design boards,
            write and assemble Z-80 code, and transfer programs to Alice II when
            we later built an I/O board, but we still
            had to reboot into DOS to program the EPROM.</p>
