            <h1>Printed Circuit Design and Construction</h1>

            <p>For the expansion cards in the Alice II, we decided to use printed
            circuits.  Our original plan was to design, prototype, construct,
            and integrate each card with some sort of start-to-finish
            design philosophy.  We ended up with a process that more or less
            matched our intentions, but with a little freedom built-in for
            how motivated we felt any given day.  We designed each board on paper,
            built a prototype, created a online copy of the printed circuit and
            transferred it to copper, etched the copper and tinned the resulting
            traces, fixed-up, drilled, soldered, and finally tested it in the
            actual Alice II card cage.</p>

            <p>The pictures in this page document the creation of the I/O board:</p>

            <p>Our initial design phase usually consisted of dinner.  Sometimes,
            over food or wine (our initial months spent on Alice were
            also spent educating ourselves about wine) we would discuss the features
            which a given board should have, and that would turn into a circuit on
            paper.  Other times, one of us would sketch out a block diagram of the
            board and bring it to Brad's apartment (and later Brad's house) for
            the initial prototype implementation.   A detailed initial paper
            design is very valuable, both for history and for later debugging. 
            Several of our boards did not function correctly when built and we
            used the initial block diagram as a debugging tool, as described
            later.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0139.jpg">

            <p>This initial diagram ranged in detail from blocks representing
            integrated circuits connected by lines indicating signals to
            detailed circuit diagrams including transistors, resistors, gates,
            etc.  We found it very useful to put down all the information we could
            gather, including pin numbers and signal abbreviations.</p>

            <p>From the design on paper, we would usually create breadboarded prototypes.
            We built two DB-25 extension cables that connected the boardboard
            to the system bus.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0118.jpg">

            <p>One board we did not fully prototype was the CPU and interrupt board,
            and we absolutely regretted that.  Our CPU prototype did not include the
            interrupt controller logic (we had no interrupting peripherals at that
            point), so we only tested that the CPU would run, then built the entire CPU
            board including the untested interrupt controller.  We spent several
            months debugging the board, finally building another complete CPU
            board to fix bugs caused by our interpretation of the interrupt
            controller documentation.  See our <a href="cpu_board.html">description
                of the CPU board</a> for details about this unfortunate problem.</p>

            <p>Once the breadboarded prototype worked to our satisfaction, we
            created an online master of the printed circuit.  We used a program
            called <a href="http://bourbon.cs.umd.edu:8001/tgif/"><i>tgif</i></a>, which was the bane of our lives for the entire
            Alice project.  We could wax prosaic about how bad <i>tgif</i> is.  
            One example of a problem we had in <i>tgif</i> was that we preferred
            laying down circuit traces at integer multiples of 45 degrees, to make
            nice pretty boards.  Until version 4, which was released after our
            last board was designed, <i>tgif</i> had no option to snap lines to 45
            degrees.  It seems like a very simple and also quite useful feature
            (most graphic design programs support it), but we spent a lot of time
            looking at the pixels in the lines on the screen trying to get as
            close to 45 degrees as possible.  To be fair, <i>tgif</i> did the job
            better than any other program we had access to under Linux, including
            <i>xfig</i>, so we deeply appreciate its existence.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0117.jpg">

            <p>We transferred this image to a transparency for ironing onto copper.
            We never seemed to finalize our process for this.  At one time, as
            is detailed in the project notebook, we printed directly onto laser
            printer transparencies.  At another time, we printed onto paper with a
            laser printer and used a copier to transfer the image to the
            transparency.  A transparency from a laser printer definitely will 
            reproduce the original design more accurately, but it seems that the
            toner deposited by a copier was more suited to ironing.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0106.jpg">

            <p>Ironing was probably the most iffy part of the process.  We sandwiched
            each transparency between a cleaned copper board (toner part against
            the copper!) and a piece of construction paper, so that the plastic
            transparency would not stick to the iron.  Because we created the
            circuit master from the perspective of the <b>parts</b> side of the
            board (some would call that the "front"), we did not have to reverse
            the printout before ironing.</p>

            <p>Each of us in turn would sit with an
            iron set to "cotton", slowly passing over the surface of the board. 
            Ironing the transparency causes the toner to melt and adhere to the
            copper.  We settled on a total ironing time of about fifteen minutes,
            since that seemed to maximize the amount of toner successfully
            transferred without making it smear too much.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0121.jpg">

            <p>Because the transfer was never perfect, we spent a certain amount of time
            afterwards fixing each trace with a circuit pen.  The heat of the
            iron would often make the transparency warp, which damaged
            some traces, especially at the edges of the board.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0120.jpg">

            <p>The copper boards were each larger than the size of the card cage we
            used for Alice II.  Each circuit was surrounded on the transparency
            by a rectangle indicating the final size for the circuit board.  We built
            a contraption out of wooden planks which allowed us to drag the circuit
            board under a rotating blade on a Dremel tool.  We cut these boards while
            wearing masks and safety goggles.  We did not want to breathe fumes from
            burning fiberglass and we did not want fiberglass or copper shards to
            go into our eyes!</p>

            <img src="../pics/0126.jpg">

            <p>Finally, we submerged each board in copper etching solution to
            remove all the copper from the board except under the toner, which is
            not affected by the etchant.  We didn't have a set time for bathing
            each board so we would occasionally pull it out and see if it
            was done.  It usually took about ten minutes, but once, while etching,
            we forgot the board was submerged for about half an hour, and,
            when we removed it, the copper <i>under the toner</i> was etched away
            and all that was left was a wash of long strands of toner!</p>

            <img src="../pics/0125.jpg">

            <p>We subsequently cleaned away the toner with steel wool.  The resulting
            board shined brightly, but, unless protected, the copper traces would
            usually oxidize after a few months and take on a dull finish.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0127.jpg">

            <p>We protected the copper from corrosion and made the board more
            receptive to soldering by plating tin on the copper traces.  We tried
            a few different tinning products, but finally settled on a bottle
            of M.G. Chemicals &ldquo;Liquid Tin&rdquo; solution (catalog item 421)
            that took about ten minutes to tin a board,
            and the solution could then be poured back into its bottle for use
            another day.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0130.jpg">

            <p>Once tinned, we needed to check the connectivity of each trace to make
            sure electricity could actually get from the bus connector to each
            component.  We would print out the master copy, check each path between
            components or to the bus, and mark the trace as checked on the
            printout.  Often we would have to correct a trace with a conductive
            pen. Some of our worse boards show off many ugly corrected traces.</p>

            <p>We drilled thousands of holes over the lifetime of this project, since
            components were placed on one side of the board and soldered on the
            other.  Drilling while standing above the board rapidly proved too
            painful, so we set up a vertical drilling stand on which we C-clamped
            the board.  Drilling was probably the most time-consuming part of
            board construction, and it was surprisingly hard for us to find drill bits
            that were the right size for component leads.  We had to use a
            slightly-too-large bit more than once, and we usually regretted it because
            the holes would cut completely through a solder pad and we'd have to solder
            very carefully to make sure the lead had contact with the ends of the trace!
            Once the holes were drilled, we soldered each component to the board.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0129.jpg">

            <p>Making a printed circuit turned out to be a lot more work than we were
            expecting.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0112.jpg">

            <p>We usually ended up designing and prototyping the
            board over a few days.  Designing the circuit master with <i>tgif</i>
            then took up to six hours sometimes spread over weeks.  We usually
            reserved an entire Saturday afternoon and evening to iron, etch, tin, fix,
            and drill, and we sometimes had to continue the next day.</p>

            <p>We certainly learned a lot about the process of manufacturing boards
            for hobby purposes.  These techniques, however, would have to be
            substantially improved for production computer hardware.  We have
            debated whether we would have been better served by wirewrapped boards.
            Our card cage has only a certain amount of clearance between cards, but
            even wirewrap leads probably would have fit.  We never tried a wirewrap
            solution, and it would have helped if we had tried both printed circuits
            and wirewrapped prototyping before we started.</p>

            <p><i>Editorial by Brad:</i> When I originally built the Alice I, I tried to
            follow as detailed a design process as possible.  It took me about two weeks,
            spending much of each night working with a graphic design tool or etching or
            drilling.  I must have been really enjoying myself and not paying attention,
            because I didn't really understand how much time it took until we started the
            same process with many larger boards instead of the one small board.</p>
