To make new library component:

- From schematic editor, click Library Editor on top (looks like a book with a pencil).
    - Click "Create a new component" (looks like an op-amp).
    - Make the new component.
    - Click "Save current component to new library" (looks like an open book).
- Go back to schematic.
- Click Preferences -> Component Libraries.
    - Click "Add" in "Component library files".
    - Select new library, then OK.
    - Can now add component to schematic.

To make PCB from schematic:

- Run CvPcb (red and green button at the top).
    - Click "View selected footprint" (magnifying glass button on top).
    - For each component, choose a footprint.
        - Use 10mm for resistors.
    - Save and close.
- Generate netlist (green "NET" button on top).
    - Use Pcbnew format, save to project directory.
- Run Pcbnew (gray icon on top).
    - Read netlist (green "NET" button on top).
        - Click "Read Current Netlist".

To lay down traces:

- Click "Add tracks and vias" on the right.
- Select layer on top ("F.Cu").
- Click to start, double-click to end.
- Command-R to redraw after each to hide ratsnest.

To make edge cuts:

- Select "Edge.Cuts" on top.
- Select "Add graphic line or polygon" at the right.
- Draw a square.

To make a copper pour:

- Select "B.Cu" on top.
- Click "Add filled zone" at the right.
- Click at one corner of pour.
- In dialog box that pops up, select side and connection (GND, etc.).
- Finish polygon within edge cuts. Double-click to finish.
- Right-click on edge of pour and choose "Fill or Refill All Zones".

To add to silkscreen (for version and other info).

- Select "F.SilkS" on top.
- Select "Add text" on right.
- Click where to add text.

To hide values (like 220 ohms):

- Hover over text and hit "E".
- Select "Invisible".
- You can also hide all of these at once when creating Gerber files.

To do a design check:

- Click the ladybug with a checkmark at the top.
- Click "Start DRC".

To make Gerber files for OSHPark:

- The default design rules are more strict than the OSHPark ones, so I didn't change them.
- Switch to mm mode (on left) because the values below are in mm.
- File -> Plot
    - Create a "gerber" subdirectory to your project dir and specify it.
    - Enable these layers:
        - F.Cu
        - B.Cu
        - B.SilkS
        - F.SilkS
        - B.Mask
        - F.Mask
        - Edge.Cuts
    - Only these checkboxes should be checked:
        - Plot footprint references
        - Exclude PCB edge layer from other layers
        - Use Protel file extensions
    - Also:
        - Drill marks: None
        - Scaling: 1:1
        - Plot mode: Filled
        - Default line width: 0.1 mm
        - Format: 4.6 (unit mm)
    - Click "Plot"
        - The OSHPark website says that the outline file has to be .GKO but the
            .GM1 generated by KiCAD works fine.
        - Don't worry if your bottom silkscreen is empty, OSHPark will automatically delete it.
    - Click "Generate Drill Files"
        - Drill units: Inches
        - Zeros format: Suppress leading zeros
        - Drill map file format: Postscript
        - Drill file options:
            - Minimal header
        - Drill origin:
            - Absolute
        - Click "Drill File"
- From main KiCAD window, click "GerbView" (the icon with magnifying glass).
    - File -> Load Gerber File
        - Select all Gerber files.
    - Check each one.
- May have to combine drill files.  (Brad's board attempt
    did not show drill holes correctly until merged.)
    - For example, from within gerbv:
        - File -> New
        - Click '+' to add *.drl
        - File -> Export -> Excellon Drill Merge
- Zip all files:
    % cd gerber
    % # Make sure to add only merged DRL to .ZIP if drill files are merged!
    % zip ../board.zip *
- Upload the ZIP file to OSHPark.

Hints:

- Press ? to get a list of hotkeys.
- Right-click on item to get actions on it (e.g., move edge of rectangle).
