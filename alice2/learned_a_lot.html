            <h1>What We Learned</h1>

            <p>First of all, we learned the value of documentation and tools for
            debugging and development.  As software engineers, we already had
            a fair grasp on how useful some design up front and a
            development journal are.</p>

            <p>As we invented boards and worked out details, we kept a written
            record in a spiral-bound notebook.  Some scans from the
            notebook are included in other pages on this web site.  This
            gave us a sense of continuity because we could look back at
            decisions we had made.  It also gave us a written archive of
            board designs for debugging and helped us ensure new boards were
            compatible with the old ones.  We referred to this notebook
            again and again over the years we worked on Alice II.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0097.jpg">

            <p>We spent a lot of time discussing design and bugs over meals,
            like chicken strips and a chocolate shake at Denny's or over
            Pizza Hut pizza.  We believe thinking about and discussing what
            to do next is critical for a successful development project.
            Research is also valuable.  Discovering the MicroChip PIC 16Cxx
            series gave us more options for communications and peripheral
            control.  Without it we would have built a complicated dedicated
            circuit for keyboard I/O and would have had to include a separate
            UART for serial.</p>

            <p>Building prototypes is another very useful technique for
            maximizing your investment in time.  It seems like a pain at
            first, but with a prototype in hand, you can tweak and quickly
            test fixes that would later require building a second printed
            circuit.  We used large prototyping breadboards for our
            experiments and found them quite useful.  Building breadboard
            versions of each of our cards in turn also buoyed
            our morale by allowing us to quickly verify that we had
            correctly guessed and learned the knowledge we were seeking.</p>

            <p>Debugging tools are <i>absolutely</i> worth the time you
            spend finding or building them.  Over the course of developing
            Alice II, we built a debug output board
            for the main bus, used a second-hand oscilloscope, built a
            binary counter with a probe, built a latching LED with a probe,
            and built a parallel port logic analyzer.  Using these tools
            allowed us to track down and fix problems that were otherwise
            intractable, but the confidence granted by our success with
            our tools was also important.</p>

            <p><em>If you are a software engineer, do not assume analog
                electronics work the way you expect!</em>  (Better yet, do not
            get involved in analog electronics.)  We spent many agonizing
            days trying to fix darkness and noise and flakiness in our video
            board.  We consulted Lawrence's Dad, a professional electronics
            engineer, and his advice was to liberally sprinkle capacitors
            all over the place.  To a software engineer, this seems like a
            bad hack at best, like &ldquo;just put in more printfs and maybe the
            crash will go away.&rdquo;  But we put two big capacitors across the
            biggest current draining chips on the video board and, lo and
            behold, our problems went away.  It turned out (apparently) that
            those chips were switching very rapidly and sucked down a lot of
            current on each switch, starving the other circuits on the board.
            Putting capacitors near them gave them a sort of private
            reserve of current for these expensive switches.</p>

            <p>We used programs to aid design whenever possible.  We used
            <i>tgif</i> to design our circuit boards.  We could have manually
            traced each board with black trace tape, but it was very useful to
            be able to just print out a new board whenever we made a change.
            We wrote scripts for extracting different colored layers from
            the line art files.  We wrote scripts for setting up the PC serial
            port, resizing and packing images and downloading binary files,
            and augmented the Z-80 compiler with the GNU C preprocessor.</p>

            <p>It's easy to over-design.  For example, we put an 8259
            interrupt controller on the CPU board, and the resulting
            botched design probably added six months of debugging to the
            project.  The PIC chip on the I/O board interrupted
            the CPU on a single IRQ line and used a protocol to specify
            which device was interrupting (keyboard, serial, or
            timer), so the 8259 wasn't even used for anything.  We
            should have simplified the design by not putting an
            8259&mdash;we just did it because other Z-80 computers had,
            not because we had foreseen a use for it.  Keep it simple!</p>

            <p>Finally, having two people working on the project was a big
            advantage.  We repeatedly encountered huge obstacles, and usually 
            one or the other of us would state that maybe we should just quit
            working on the project altogether.  If the other person had
            agreed, the Alice II project would have ended long ago.  Instead,
            we managed to balance out most of the time, so having at least one
            person motivated to complete the project at any given time
            was extremely helpful.</p>
