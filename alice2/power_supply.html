            <h1>Power Supply</h1>

            <p>The power supply that came with the modem case provided, we think, 18
            volts AC.  (It was really just a transformer.)  We needed 5
            volts DC, so we set out to modify it.  We used a bridge
            rectifier to turn the AC into pulsating DC, a capacitor to
            smooth that out, and a 7505 to clamp the voltage to 5
            volts.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0074.jpg">

            <p>We went through a
            considerable amount of trouble with a metal clamp to cut out
            a hole large enough for an amp meter.  This meter was
            invaluable when building later boards, because it showed us
            when we had a short circuit or anything suspicious in our
            wiring.  Normally we hovered around 1 amp, and a
            short-circuit would peg the meter all the way to the
            right.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0075.jpg">

            <p>One problem is that the 7505 can only pass about half an
            amp, and we were not sure that would be enough.  Also, Lawrence had
            made a mistake in his design&dash;the &ldquo;ground&rdquo; that the power
            supply generated was indeed always 5 volts lower than the
            power line, but the pair oscillated at 60 Hz between 0/5
            volts and -5/0 volts.  This worked fine when the Alice II
            was working in isolation, but when we hooked it up to
            another computer (through a serial line), the grounds got
            connected, confusing the PC's serial board.</p>

            <p>So we dropped that and just used a regular PC power supply,
            which gave us more than enough power.  We missed the amp
            meter, and in retrospect we should have added one in series
            with the PC power supply.</p>
